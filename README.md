## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Developers often face repetitive issues and bugs while coding, and searching for solutions on forums like Stack Overfbw can be time-consuming.
Our proposed Stack Overflow Auto Search Tool aims to automate this process, making it easier for developers to find relevant solutions quickly. 
The tool will parse error messages from the development environment and automatically search Stack Overflow for solutions, displaying the most relevant results to the user.
